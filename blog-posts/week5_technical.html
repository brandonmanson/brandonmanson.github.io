					<p>Ruby is a great language for many reasons: easy syntax, it's object-oriented and you can accomplish a lot with just a little code. The most effective way of tying all of these aspects together is grouping data into classes.</p>
					<h4>What the heck is a class?</h4>
					<p>A class is a structure that binds data and functionality together, allowing you to easily create new objects that inherit data and functionality.</p>
					<p>Let's look at this in a more comprehensive way. Let's say you wanted to quickly create a bracket for a basketball tournament that included the starting five players for each team.</p>
					<h4>Let's make one</h4>
					<p>Let's create our class</p>
					
					<code>
						class BasketballTeam
						<br>
						<br>
						end
					</code>
					
					<p>Now we need to make it so that any new instance of BasketballTeam can take five players and make that data accessible. I'll expand on that in a minute.</p>
					
					<code>
						class BasketballTeam
						<br>
						<blockquote>def initialize(pg, sg, sf, f, c)<br>
							<blockquote>
								@pg = pg
								<br>
								@sg = sg
								<br>
								@sf = sf
								<br>
								@f  = f
								<br>
								@c  = c
								<br>
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
						</blockquote>
						end
					</code>
					
					<p>Now let's make it so that you can quickly access each player's name by position (i.e. Point guard for Michigan State. Which makes me a little sad. He would have been an All-American if hadn't hurt his wrist). We'll define methods point_guard, shooting_guard, small_forward, forward and center that, when called for a new instance of class BasketballTeam, will return the name of the player.</p>
					<code>
						class BasketballTeam
						<br>
						<blockquote>
							def initialize(pg, sg, sf, f, c)<br>
							<blockquote>
								@pg = pg
								<br>
								@sg = sg
								<br>
								@sf = sf
								<br>
								@f  = f
								<br>
								@c  = c
								<br>
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def point_guard
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@pg}"
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def shooting_guard
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@sg}"
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def small_forward
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@sf}"
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def forward
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@f}"
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def center
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@c}"
							</blockquote>
							end
						</blockquote>
						end
					</code>
					<p>Now let's create a few teams and grab individual players.</p>
					<code>
						class BasketballTeam
						<br>
						<blockquote>
							def initialize(pg, sg, sf, f, c)<br>
							<blockquote>
								@pg = pg
								<br>
								@sg = sg
								<br>
								@sf = sf
								<br>
								@f  = f
								<br>
								@c  = c
								<br>
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def point_guard
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@pg}"
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def shooting_guard
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@sg}"
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def small_forward
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@sf}"
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def forward
							<br>
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@f}"
							</blockquote>
							end
							<br>
							<br>
							def center
							<blockquote>
								puts "#{@c}"
							</blockquote>
							end
						</blockquote>
						end
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						MSU = BasketballTeam.new("Keith Appling", "Gary Harris", "Denzel Valentine", "Branden Dawson", "Adreian Payne")
						<br>
						MSU.center #-> Adreian Payne
						<br>
						<br>
						UConn = BasketballTeam.new("Shabazz Napier", "Ryan Boatright", "Omar Calhoun", "DeAndre Daniels", "Tyler Olander")
						<br>
						UConn.small_forward #-> Omar Calhoun
						<br>
						<br>
						UK = BasketballTeam.new("Andrew Harrison", "Aaron Harrison", "Alex Poythress", "Julius Randle", "Willie Cauley-Stein")
						<br>
						UK.point_guard #-> Andrew Harrison
					</code>
					<p>This is a simple demonstration of how a class works, but the benefits are obvious: we are making our code much more DRY and allowing ourselves tons of flexibility to change and upgrade our class later on as our needs change.</p>
