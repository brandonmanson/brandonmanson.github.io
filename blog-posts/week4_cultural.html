					<p>The conversation around women in tech is heating up and this seems like the perfect opportunity to give a slightly different point of view: a white guy's. Now that's not saying that other white guys haven't written about this issue already, but I had a sudden moment of clarity the other night I'd like to expound upon</p>
					<h4>I lack empathy</h4>
					<p>Yep. I'm not going to waste your time and lead you to it. This, for me, is one of the biggest issues we currently face. Men, especially white men, lack empathy for the gender biases commonly attributed to the disparity in tech. This isn't our fault, nor is it the fault of anyone else. This is the society we've grown up in: men take on careers in certain fields, while women take on careers in others.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, these societal norms and expectations are something I am not equipped to take on (although I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP3cyRRAfX0">this Verizon ad</a> could help get the ball rolling).</p>
					<h4>What can be done?</h4>
					<p>Societal norms are tough to change overnight. It shouldn't be quite as tough to change the mindset of an individual (I know, I know; just hang with me for a second). So my recommendation is this:</p>
					<p>Men and women should not have different expecations for the workplace. Everyone deserves to feel comfortable, empowered and appreciated. If you don't, say something. We all need to be equal partners in changing the culture of tech and opening doors for everyone. Be proactive, be mindful and, most importantly, be awesome at what you do.</p>
