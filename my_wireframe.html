			<p>As part of our week 2 curriculum, we've been told to learn a thing or two about design and apply it to our GitHub pages! Here's what I've done thus far.</p>

					<h4>The Wireframe</h4>

					<p>It's a pretty basic, simple sketch I admit. However I had the design in my head already and wanted to get to coding instead of spending too much time sketching it out. As I go back and iterate, I will likely spend more time sketching.</p>

					<h4>Design Thoughts</h4>
					<p>My main goal for the design is to keep things looking simple and elegant by taking advantage of lots of negative space. Eventually I would like to add a two-column layout for my blog posts with featured images, but for this version I simply centered everything.</p>

					<h4>What's Next</h4>
					<p>There is tons of work yet to be done. Here is what's coming in the next iteration:</p>
					<p>-Media Queries to make the site truly responsive</p>
					<p>-Column layout for blog posts</p>
					<p>-Social icons in the sticky header</p>
					<p>-Updated blog template to reflect the new design of the home page, ensuring a consistent user experience throughout.</p>
					<p>That's it for now. Be sure to check back soon for updates, and please give feedback in the group!</p>
